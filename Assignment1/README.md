This Project implements “Travelling salesman problem using heuristic search algorithms(Hill Climbing and Random search algorithms)”

Hill climbing is a heuristic search algorithm which continuously moves in a elevated direction to reach the peak of the hill(best solution)

Dependency:
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Random
- Copy

To Rapidly implement the work:
- Download and unzip the assignment1.ipynb file and the dataset pr76.tsp file
- Load the dataset on Google Collab in the folders section and execute the code
- If you want to implement on Jupyter Notebook install the packages using pip and run the code


Example: pip install <req_package_name>  pip install numpy
